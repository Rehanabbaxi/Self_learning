Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

       "'The \"Attention is All You Need\" paper introduced several new ideas and innovations in the field of natural language processing (NLP):\\n\\n1. Multi-head Attention: The paper proposed a new attention mechanism called multi-head attention, which allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. This allows the model to capture longer-range dependencies and better handle input sequences with varying lengths.\\n2. Parallel Attention Layers: The authors proposed using multiple parallel attention layers, each with its own set of learnable parameters. This reduces the computational cost of attention while maintaining its expressive power.\\n3. Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks: The paper introduced the use of position-wise feed-forward networks (FFNs) in addition to attention sub-layers. FFNs are used to process each position separately and identically, allowing the model to capture non-linear interactions between tokens.\\n4. Learned Embeddings and Softmax: The authors proposed using learned embeddings to convert input tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel, and then applying a learned linear transformation and softmax function to predict the next token in the sequence.\\n5. Sharing Weight Matrix: The paper introduced the idea of sharing the weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, which helps to reduce the number of parameters and improve the model\\'s efficiency.\\n\\nIn simple words, the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper introduced several new techniques to improve the performance of attention mechanisms in NLP tasks, including:\\n\\n* Using multiple parallel attention layers to reduce computational cost while maintaining expressive power.\\n* Adding position-wise feed-forward networks to capture non-linear interactions between tokens.\\n* Using learned embeddings and a shared weight matrix to improve efficiency and reduce the number of parameters.\\n* Proposing new attention mechanisms, such as multi-head attention, to better handle input sequences with varying lengths.'"
